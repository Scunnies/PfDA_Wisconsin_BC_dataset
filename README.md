# PfDA_Wisconsin_BC_dataset
Assignment to investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset# PfDA_Assignment
***

This repository contains my second submission for the Programming for Data Analysis module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics.

### Assignment Brief:

The objectives of this assignment are:

* Undertake an analysis/review of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and present an overview and background
* Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance
* Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
* Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results
* Detail rationale for the parameter selections made while training the classifiers
* Compare, contrast and critique results with reference to the literature
* Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints
* Document all work in a Jupyter notebook. 

### Contents of repository:

- Readme file
- The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.ipynb notebook containing research and analysis
- data.csv file containing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
- git ignore 

Python 3 was used to develop this project and is needed to run the code in the notebook. Python 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or using the Anaconda Python distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

The Jupyter Notebook can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser without Python 3 being installed. 
If the repository is downloaded it can be run locally by navigating to the folder and entering the command jupyter lab or jupyter notebook on the command line. This will open Jupyter in the browser. 

The main python libraries used are loaded at the start of the code. The code should be run from top to bottom. 

### How to clone this repository

On GitHub at https://github.com/Scunnies/PfDA_Wisconsin_BC_dataset click the green `Code` button, copy the URL for the repository. Open Git Bash, change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory, type `git clone`, and then paste the URL. Press Enter to create your local clone.
